The frequency of sequences was meticulously calculated utilizing advanced data structures,facilitating the determination of the sequences' states, whether diseased, permutated, or normal. Various sophisticated algorithms, including Patricia Trie, Boyer Moore, Rabin Karp, Bitap, Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), Trie, Suffix Array, Wavelet Tree, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), and Bloom Filter, were employed to ascertain frequencies within the exon ranges of mRNA. These computational techniques enabled precise and efficient frequency analysis, significantly contributing to the understanding of sequence states in a genomic context. By leveraging these algorithms, we achieved a high degree of accuracy in frequency 
determination, which is crucial for identifying and annotating genomic features. Here the inputs will be the dna sequence in a mRNA file and the exon ranges from the specific dna sequence and the disease associated pattern.
